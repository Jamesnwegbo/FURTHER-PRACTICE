<p>Dear All,

 

Welcome to the 4th quarter of 2022 and our Customer Service Week!!!

 

The Customer Service Week is coming right after we had such a great Employee Appreciation Week and I think it is fitting to once again say “thank you” for all the work you do. As we serve our dear customers this final quarter of the year, let me once again remind us that our customers are the reason for our being. There is no us without our customers.

 

I encourage you to read the content of the message below which has been sent to customers, share this with all branch staff and send to your contacts/customers on WhatsApp.

 

I am counting on you to give our customers what they deserve…..The Best-in-Class Service…

 

Have an excellent Customer Service Week…

 

Regards    </p>
